<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a second-year graduate student in the [M.S. in Economics and Computation (MSEC)](https://econ.duke.edu/masters-programs/degree-programs/msec) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/). My current research focuses on social networks and computational social science (CSS). Substantively, I study human dynamics in networks and complex social systems, in particular how information, opinions, and behaviors diffuse to shape collective outcomes, both empirically and theoretically. Methodologically, I am also interested in network-based causal inference and experiments, as well as mathematical or game-theoretic modeling in networked settings.
