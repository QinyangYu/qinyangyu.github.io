# Cluster 1: Networks, Experiments, & Games

### [Understanding Chinese-speaking Trump Supporters Online: Features, Factors, and Intervention Strategies of Political Opinion Extremism in the X Network during the 2020 U.S. Election](files/research/SICSS_Pre.pdf)
**SICSS, NYU Shanghai, Jun.2025**
- This group project analyzed the retweet network and texts of 260 Chinese-speaking Trump supporters on X, explored the relationship between network structure and ideological extremity using LDA, SHAP, and GNNExplainer, and discussed intervention strategies  
- Simulated counterfactual network interventions via the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model in Python; compared five rewiring algorithms to effectively reduce extremity; contributed to a 20-minute oral and a poster presentation for the Ideathon event in SICSS  

### [Who Gets the Blame? A Structural Theory of Scapegoating in Social Networks (Old Draft)](files/research/Working_Paper_1.pdf)  
**Supervised by Duke’s Prof. Charles Becker, Dec.2024 – Present**  
**Abstract:** Scapegoating often targets marginalized individuals. Existing accounts focus on identity attributes. In contrast, this paper develops a structural theory of scapegoating that emphasizes how network position shapes vulnerability to unfair blame. A leader facing systemic failure strategically decides whether to self-blame or scapegoat, while agents embedded in a network update beliefs and form public opinions through social learning. Game-theoretic analysis shows that scapegoating systematically targets peripheral nodes with lower centrality. The findings offer insights into the structural mechanism driving inequality and social injustice in interconnected communities.

### [Network Experiments under Dynamic Treatment Diffusion: Design and Estimation for Bias Reduction](files/research/590.06-Sp05-Liu-Yu-Network Experiments under Dynamic Treatment Diffusion Design and Estimation for Bias Reduction.pdf)  
**Supervised by Duke’s Prof. Sudeepa Roy, Mar.2025 – May.2025**  
- Simulated the design and analysis of network experiments under treatment diffusion to reduce bias in estimating ATE  
- Introduced the Independent Cascade Model (ICM) for treatment diffusion; compared random vs. cluster assignment paired with individual vs. neighborhood-based estimators; explored alternative diffusion patterns via the Linear Threshold Model (LTM)  
- Found that cluster randomization combined with neighborhood-based estimators effectively reduces bias and improves accuracy, particularly when treatment or spillover effects are strong; final report scored 39/40  

### [Government Endorsement and Voter Skepticism: An Experiment of Selective Disclosure in Political Communication](files/research/ECON_690_Concept_Paper_Group_3.pdf)  
**Supervised by FSU’s Prof. Pellumb Reshidi, Mar.2025 – May.2025**  
- Investigated how explicit knowledge of government bias shapes voter skepticism under truthful yet selectively disclosed information  
- Proposed a sender–receiver communication game with a skeptical PBE for hypothesis testing; designed an experiment randomly assigning participants to interact with a neutral or biased government to test equilibrium selection and deviation  
- Linked information disclosure and sender credibility to experimental findings on the interactive effects of bias and transparency in collective decision-making; proposal scored 94/100, coding 89/100, and paper 91/100  

### [Lawful Roots, Lawless Routes: The Paradox of Litigation-Related Petitions in China](files/research/Independent_Research_1.pdf)    
**Supervised by CUHKsz’s Prof. Yangbo Song, Sep.2023 – Dec.2023**  
- Modeled why litigation-related petitions, despite clear legal boundaries, are more likely to escalate into unauthorized forms  
- Collected 5-year local government petition data and 4 official interviews; Constructed a Bayesian learning process and analyzed comparative statics; revealed a amplification mechanism where petitioners misinterpret legal signals and form biased posteriors  
- Proposed strategies to resolve conflicts and preserve social order by adjusting information delivery  

### [A Game Theoretic Analysis for Witch Killing and Human Sacrifice](files/research/ECO3160_Paper.pdf)    
**Supervised by CUHKsz’s Prof. Yangbo Song, Dec.2022**  
- Constructed a Bayesian game to analyze witch killing and human sacrifice under incomplete information in rural Africa and India  
- Compared SPNE and PBE to explain collective religious violence and proposed five preventive approaches as model implications

# Cluster 2: Applied Econometrics, Policy, & Development

### [Pension Policy as a Pathway to Happiness: Insights from China’s New Rural Pension Scheme](files/research/Working_Paper_2.pdf)    
**Coauthored with Cambridge’s Dr. Saite Lu, Aug.2023 – Present**  
- Extended subjective well-being (SWB) to three OECD-defined sub-dimensions (cognition, affect, eudaimonia) and sub-components  
- Processed CFPS cross-sectional data; exploited a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to estimate the causal impact of China’s New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS) on SWB among rural elderly residents, with stronger gains in affect and eudaimonia  
- Validated design via density smoothness and 13 predetermined covariates; ruled out retirement shocks at age 60; conducted robustness checks; identified multi-dimensional heterogeneity with policy implications across education, family, social class, and regions  
- Completed a Cambridge Summer Program working paper with distinction; published in CUHKsz’s *Fairy Lake Economic Journal*  

### [On the Development Path of Hong Kong and Singapore Economy: Is the Industrial Policy Important?](files/research/Independent_Research_3.pdf)    
**Supervised by CUHKsz’s Prof. Chunrong Ai, Jun.2022 – Jul.2023**  
- Investigated how differences in industrial policy shaped industrial structure and economic development in Hong Kong and Singapore  
- Collected and Visualized data from World Bank and government yearbooks; Quantified divergence and generated policy dummies; estimated a structural VAR with exogenous shocks and analyzed IRFs and variance decomposition under two Cholesky orderings  
- Performed ADF unit-root and Granger-causality tests; selected optimal lags via AIC/SBC; ran residual and stability diagnostics  
- Delivered policy recommendations on manufacturing and industrial coordination; received 19th–21st Undergraduate Research Awards  

### [Predicting Default Rate of Lending Club Loans: Lasso-Penalized Logistic Regression and Nonlinear Methods](files/research/ECO3080_Paper.pdf)    
**Supervised by CUHKsz’s Prof. Qihui Chen, Dec.2022**  
- Constructed training/test splits and visualized multicollinearity in R; fitted lasso and elastic-net logistic models to handle high dimensionality; tuned λ via cross-validation and the one-standard-error rule; plotted lasso paths and ROC curves for model selection  
- Compared linear vs. nonlinear models (RF, GNN) using specificity, accuracy, and time complexity; achieved project score of 96.6/100  

### Total Factor Productivity and Social Capital  
**Research Assistant, Supervised by Cambridge’s Dr. Saite Lu , Aug.2023 – Jun.2024**  
- Computed weighted averages of trust variables in STATA; merged panel data across European NUTS2 regions; identified 17 controls  
- Applied OLS, two-way fixed effects, system GMM, and semiparametric regressions; found positive impacts of social trust on TFP
