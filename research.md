# Cluster 1: Networks, Experiments, & Games

### [Understanding Chinese-speaking Trump Supporters Online: Features, Factors, and Intervention Strategies of Political Opinion Extremism in the X Network during the 2020 U.S. Election](files/research/SICSS_Pre.pdf)
**SICSS, NYU Shanghai, Jun.2025**
**Abstract:** This project analyzes the retweet network and texts of 260 Chinese-speaking Trump supporters on X. We explore the relationship between network structure and ideological extremity using topic modeling and explainable AI methods. In addition, we simulate counterfactual network interventions via the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model and compared five rewiring algorithms to effectively reduce extremity.

### [Who Gets the Blame? A Structural Theory of Scapegoating in Social Networks (Old Draft)](files/research/Working_Paper_1.pdf)  
**Supervised by Duke’s Prof. Charles Becker, Dec.2024 – Present**  
**Abstract:** Scapegoating often targets marginalized individuals. Existing accounts focus on identity attributes. In contrast, this paper develops a structural theory of scapegoating that emphasizes how network position shapes vulnerability to unfair blame. A leader facing systemic failure strategically decides whether to self-blame or scapegoat, while agents embedded in a network update beliefs and form public opinions through social learning. Game-theoretic analysis shows that scapegoating systematically targets peripheral nodes with lower centrality. The findings offer insights into the structural mechanism driving inequality and social injustice in interconnected communities.

### [Network Experiments under Dynamic Treatment Diffusion: Design and Estimation for Bias Reduction](files/research/590.06-Sp05-Liu-Yu-Network Experiments under Dynamic Treatment Diffusion Design and Estimation for Bias Reduction.pdf)  
**Supervised by Duke’s Prof. Sudeepa Roy, Mar.2025 – May.2025**  
**Abstract:** This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for designing and analyzing network experiments under treatment diffusion dynamics, extending the work of Eckles et al. (2017). We focus on improving treatment assignment design and estimation strategies to reduce bias in estimating the average treatment effect (ATE). The framework consists of five phases: initialization, treatment assignment, treatment diffusion, outcome generation, and estimation. We introduce the Independent Cascade Model (ICM) as the key innovation for modeling treatment diffusion and evaluate two treatment assignment designs—independent random assignment and graph cluster randomization—along with three estimators. Our main result shows that neighborhood-based estimators combined with clustered assignment effectively reduce bias, improve accuracy, and remains robust, particularly when treatment or spillover effects are strong. Additionally, we extend our framework by analyzing sensitivity to diffusion speed and exploring alternative diffusion patterns using the Linear Threshold Model (LTM).

**Supervised by CUHKsz’s Prof. Yangbo Song, Sep.2023 – Dec.2023**  
**Abstract:**

### [A Game Theoretic Analysis for Witch Killing and Human Sacrifice](files/research/ECO3160_Paper.pdf)    
**Supervised by CUHKsz’s Prof. Yangbo Song, Dec.2022**  
- Constructed a Bayesian game to analyze witch killing and human sacrifice under incomplete information in rural Africa and India  
- Compared SPNE and PBE to explain collective religious violence and proposed five preventive approaches as model implications
