# Cluster 1: Networks, Experiments, & Games

### [Understanding Chinese-speaking Trump Supporters Online: Features, Factors, and Intervention Strategies of Political Opinion Extremism in the X Network during the 2020 U.S. Election](files/research/SICSS_Pre.pdf)
**SICSS, NYU Shanghai, Jun.2025**  
**Abstract:** This project analyzes the retweet network and texts of 260 Chinese-speaking Trump supporters on X. We explore the relationship between network structure and ideological extremity using topic modeling and explainable AI methods. In addition, we simulate counterfactual network interventions via the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model and compared five rewiring algorithms to effectively reduce extremity.

### [Who Gets the Blame? A Structural Theory of Scapegoating in Social Networks (Old Draft)](files/research/Working_Paper_1.pdf)  
**Supervised by Duke’s Prof. Charles Becker, Dec.2024 – Present**  
**Abstract:** Scapegoating often targets marginalized individuals. Existing accounts focus on identity attributes. In contrast, this paper develops a structural theory of scapegoating that emphasizes how network position shapes vulnerability to unfair blame. A leader facing systemic failure strategically decides whether to self-blame or scapegoat, while agents embedded in a network update beliefs and form public opinions through social learning. Game-theoretic analysis shows that scapegoating systematically targets peripheral nodes with lower centrality. The findings offer insights into the structural mechanism driving inequality and social injustice in interconnected communities.

### [Network Experiments under Dynamic Treatment Diffusion: Design and Estimation for Bias Reduction](files/research/590.06-Sp05-Liu-Yu-Network Experiments under Dynamic Treatment Diffusion Design and Estimation for Bias Reduction.pdf)  
**Supervised by Duke’s Prof. Sudeepa Roy, Mar.2025 – May.2025**  
**Abstract:** This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for designing and analyzing network experiments under treatment diffusion dynamics, extending the work of Eckles et al. (2017). We focus on improving treatment assignment design and estimation strategies to reduce bias in estimating the average treatment effect (ATE). The framework consists of five phases: initialization, treatment assignment, treatment diffusion, outcome generation, and estimation. We introduce the Independent Cascade Model (ICM) as the key innovation for modeling treatment diffusion and evaluate two treatment assignment designs—independent random assignment and graph cluster randomization—along with three estimators. Our main result shows that neighborhood-based estimators combined with clustered assignment effectively reduce bias, improve accuracy, and remains robust, particularly when treatment or spillover effects are strong. Additionally, we extend our framework by analyzing sensitivity to diffusion speed and exploring alternative diffusion patterns using the Linear Threshold Model (LTM).

### [Government Endorsement and Voter Skepticism: An Experiment of Selective Disclosure in Political Communication](files/research/ECON_690_Concept_Paper_Group_3.pdf)  
**Supervised by FSU’s Prof. Pellumb Reshidi, Mar.2025 – May.2025**  
**Abstract:** This paper investigates how explicit knowledge of government bias influences voter skepticism when truthful but selectively disclosed information is presented. We propose a theoretical framework and characterize skeptical and credible Perfect Bayesian Equilibria. We design an individual experiment by randomly assigning participants to interact with either a neutral or biased government with different disclosure strategies. In each round, subjects receive a truthful but potentially ambiguous message, update beliefs, and decide whether to vote for a policy alternative. We test skeptical equilibrium selection under strategic uncertainty and skeptical equilibrium deviation under strategic certainty. Our study contributes to political-communication literature by linking theories of information disclosure and sender credibility to experimental evidence on how bias and transparency jointly shape collective decision-making.

### [Lawful Roots, Lawless Routes: The Paradox of Litigation-Related Petitions in China](files/research/Independent_Research_1.pdf)    
**Supervised by CUHKsz’s Prof. Yangbo Song, Sep.2023 – Dec.2023**  
**Abstract:** In the absence of a robust legal framework, petitions in China present significant governance challenges. Counter-intuitively, among specific types of petitions, litigation-related petitions are particularly more prone to escalate into unauthorized forms compared to others without clear legal boundaries. Why does a law-rooted system eventually generate universal lawless behaviors? This study offers a theoretical explanation and examines factors contributing to this problematic type of petitions. We incorporate petitioners into a Bayesian learning process with a biased legal signal structure. Concurrently, the local government interacts by setting a Poisson-distributed arrival rate of returns. Our findings highlight an amplification mechanism where petitioners misinterpret legal norms and form biased posterior beliefs. As a practical application, the model suggests that adjusting how information is conveyed and modifying the governance environment could serve as preventive strategies in local governance.

### [A Game Theoretic Analysis for Witch Killing and Human Sacrifice](files/research/ECO3160_Paper.pdf)    
**Supervised by CUHKsz’s Prof. Yangbo Song, Dec.2022**  
**Abstract:** We model witch killing as a sequential game between a leader and villagers under incomplete information. The pooling equilibrium explains why communities accept killing even of innocents. Policy implications highlight income support, education, family bonds, legal punishment, and democratic checks as ways to shift incentives against violence.

# Cluster 2: Applied Econometrics, Policy, & Development

### [Pension Policy as a Pathway to Happiness: Insights from China’s New Rural Pension Scheme](files/research/Working_Paper_2.pdf)    
**Coauthored with Cambridge’s Dr. Saite Lu, Aug.2023 – Present**  
**Abstract:** The significance of subjective well-being (SWB) in the development agenda has gained growing recognition in both academic and policy discussions. However, the intricate structure of SWB, which includes multiple sub-dimensions, remains insufficiently examined. This study addresses this gap by analysing SWB across three sub-dimensions—cognition, affect, and eudaimonia—as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It focuses on the impact of China’s New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS), introduced in 2009, employing a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to establish a causal link between NRPS participation and SWB. The findings reveal that receiving the pension significantly enhances SWB among rural elderly residents, with particularly strong improvements in the affective and eudaimonic dimensions. Additionally, the study identifies multi-dimensional heterogeneity in the scheme’s effectiveness, offering policy insights in educational, family, social-class, and regional inequalities.

### [On the Development Path of Hong Kong and Singapore Economy: Is the Industrial Policy Important?](files/research/Independent_Research_3.pdf)    
**Supervised by CUHKsz’s Prof. Chunrong Ai, Jun.2022 – Jul.2023**  
**Abstract:** Singapore and Hong Kong exhibit numerous parallels, including their size, historical narratives, status as free trade ports, and economic take-off post the 1960s. However, they significantly differ in the government’s role in industrial policies. While the Hong Kong government adheres to a laissez-faire approach, the Singaporean government actively promotes and nurtures specific industries and upgrades manufacturing sectors. This case study investigates the consequence of these policy differences and the dynamics between industrial and development divergence. The results from a structural vector autoregressive (VAR) framework with exogenous policy shocks show that manufacturing serves as a linchpin in the mechanism of how industrial policies lead to development divergence.

### [Predicting Default Rate of Lending Club Loans: Lasso-Penalized Logistic Regression and Nonlinear Methods](files/research/ECO3080_Paper.pdf)    
**Supervised by CUHKsz’s Prof. Qihui Chen, Dec.2022**  
**Abstract:** This study applies logistic, lasso-logit, tree-based, and neural network models to predict default rate in Lending Club loans. We emphasize specificity to reduce false positives. Results show plain logistic regression balances accuracy and efficiency best, while lasso-logit and neural nets improve AUC at higher cost, and tree-based methods underperform on specificity.
